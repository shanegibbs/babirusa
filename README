# Development Setup

## Ubuntu

```
% apt-get install libdb5.3 libdb5.3-dev
% apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
% mkdir build-ubuntu
% cd build-ubuntu
% CFLAGS=-rdynamic ../configure --enable-debug
% make
```

## Mac

gdb has been replaced with lldb

```
% mkdir build-mac
% cd build-mac
% ../configure --enable-debug
% make
```

# Planning

* Create file table
* Backup to path
* Restore to path
* Backup to S3

## Scan logic

- [x] Scan for filename, mtime and length
- [ ] Add to db
- [ ] Check info with db. If size change, backup file
  - [ ] If no mtime change, continue
  - [ ] If mtime change, check hash
    - [ ] If hash changed, backup file
    - [ ] If no change, update mtime

## Backup logic

* Needs to handle new files, deleted files and changed files
* Produce different versions of a single file

Record:
* filename
* size
* mtime
* hash
* deleted_at
